Working:
- Getting checksums of file


Needed (in order of probable difficulty):
- Splitting file into chunks of size n
- Reassembling chunks back into full file
- Somehow autodetecting when a file is put into the shared folder
- Network connection from one server to one client
- Network connection broadly through LAN
- Network connection broadly through internet
